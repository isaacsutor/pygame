# rocketevasiongame
This is a rocket evasion game built around PyGame.

Currently the game goes on forever until you die with no objective other than to live, 
but I will be implementing scores, lives, packages to pick up, and a menu

Things to implement:
1. Score that displays in bottom left corner and updates based on time alive
2. Lives: jet image in the bottom left corner next to score with "xnum" where num is the number of lives left
3. Death Screen: when lives = 0 and dead -> display "You Died. Final Score: ______" and a replay option below
4. High Score: save highest score in file and display on top of screen
